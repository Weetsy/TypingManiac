-go to prefences->settings then make sure you're selecting for this workspace and not this user
-search 'Code Actions on Save'
-add this ' "eslint.format.enable": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }' to the file opened with the step above (the code actions on save one)
